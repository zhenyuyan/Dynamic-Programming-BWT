{\bf [25 points] Suffix Tries}\\

\vspace{0.1in}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the \textbf{Suffix \underline{Trie}} for the sequence ``ATGATGC". (Include a picture of your trie in your writup)
    \item What is the longest repeat in the sequence? Explain how you are able to find this using the trie you drew. Draw a circle around the feature of your trie that indicates this (just draw it on the picture in part (a) ).
    \item Why is the termination character ``\$" necessary? (\textit{Hint:} try removing it from the leaves of your completed suffix trie, and explain any issues that arise).
    \item For a string of length $N$ characters, what is the maximum number of nodes a suffix trie could have? Explain.
\end{enumerate}
