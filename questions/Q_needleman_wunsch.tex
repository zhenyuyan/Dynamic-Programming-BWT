Complete the function \texttt{needleman\_wunsch} in the python script \textbf{\texttt{NW.py}} to implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with the scoring function below:

\[
\left\{
  \begin{tabular}{l r}
  Match:    & 0 \\
  Mismatch: & -1 \\
  Gap:      & -1
  \end{tabular}
\right.
\]
 
\fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{
\textbf{Note: }{Your code is graded by an autograder. The script should be able to run with command line:\\

\texttt{python NW.py example.fasta}\\

The \texttt{needlman\_wunsch} function should return a single value, a string with three lines with the following format:\\
\fbox{\parbox{0.4\textwidth}{
alignment score\\
alignment in the first sequence\\
alignment in the second sequence}}\\

Each of the three items should be in separate lines, no space in front of or after each line (the box is not a part of the format). For example:\\
\fbox{\parbox{0.4\textwidth}{
\texttt{-2}\\
\texttt{AT-GC}\\
\texttt{ATTGA}}}
}
}}
